=========

A simple repo for me to store sample code as I learn go.

If I come up with anything interesting I will highlight it here
structs
-------
* structs/struct1.go 
* structs/struct2.go
struct2 is more interesting as we are storing pointers to structs within slices

array has some interesting attempts to understand array and slices

the zLogCheck directory has an attempt to create a logparser to understand options for sysAdmin type functionality
this has actually been very interesting
